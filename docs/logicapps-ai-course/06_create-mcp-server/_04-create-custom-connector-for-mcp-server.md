In this module, you will learn how to create a custom conenctor for an MCP server. With this, you can setup auth type like APIKey, OAuth (Generic, AAD, Github, and so on). You can use and reuse this connector to add MCP server in Agent Loop for multiple agents and connect via API Connection.

In this lab, we will use MCP server we created in Azure Logic App.
